Logator
=======

Build your own log parser.


Using it
--------

Log is handled as an iterable lines object. The basic example is a file.

You build your own parser with multiple heritage. Attributes can be static (from a regex parsing) or dynamic.
Logator handles lazy loading and memoization.

You can use filters.

User Agent parsing is stolen from Google code.

	from logator.log import log
	from logator.weblog import Common, UserAgent, HostByName, Filter_by_code, Filter_by_attribute
	
	class Line(Common, UserAgent, HostByName):
		pass
	
	f = open('/var/log/apache2/access.log', 'r')
	for line in log(Line, f, Filter_by_code([200]) | Filter_by_attribute('command', 'HEAD')):
		print line.url, line.userAgent.pretty(), line.os#, line.hostByName

The futur
---------

 - √ Parsing http server log
 - _ Reading stdin
 - _ Filling a mongo database
 - _ IP to country
 - _ Querying
 - _ Nice graph from stored data
